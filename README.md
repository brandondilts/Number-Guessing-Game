# Number-Guessing-Game
First small project in python. Given a maximum number x, the program will randomly pick between 1-x and you will guess what it is with the program giving you hint on each guess.

Run numberGuessingGame.py and call startGameGUI(x) where the variable x is the largest possible value you want the program to choose.
